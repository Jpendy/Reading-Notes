### NOTES

container {
    min-width: 300px;
    max-width: 800px
}

- use min-width and max-width to set minumum and maximum sizes on boxes, to control the size for larger monitors or if the window is dragged wider or narrower.

- min-height and max-height do the same thing for height.


- display: inline; will make a block acting element act like an inline element. Like if you want to make a list where list items sit side by side in a row rather than column

- 0 with no quotes is falsy but '0' in a string is truthy. because strings with content are truthy. 'false' in a string is truthy
