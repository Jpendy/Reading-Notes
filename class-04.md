# Notes

- Use full address in src for links to other websites

- Can use just file name as src for links to other pages on your website, as long as their in the same folder

- The css float property allows you to push an element all the way to the right or left. Make sure it has a width to work correctly. float: right or float: left

- z index can controls which element sits on the other, when elements overlap it controls what is more in the foreground, and what's behind in the back
