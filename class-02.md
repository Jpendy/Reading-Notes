### Javascript reading notes

-scripts are made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe

- Bits of information are stored in variables. 

- The information stored in a variable can be different or vary everytime a script runs

- Before you can use a variable you have to declare it and give it a name

- After declaring a variable you must assign a value to the variable

- A variable's name should describle the type of value that it holds

- expressions use two or more values and return a single value

- expressions use operators, and are used to create a single value from more values
