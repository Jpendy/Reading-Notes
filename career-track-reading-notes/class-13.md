# Notes 

- The aggregate pipeline was really interesting to read about and seems extremely powerful.

- First is the match stage, where the $match command is used and seems to behave much .find or WHERE from sql, or like a .filter. It seems like you set a condition and whatever meets it is pulled.

- Next is the grouping stage. I don't totally understand this quite yet. Something about grouping documents together for some reason.

- aggregations can be used to do a lot of calculations and data filtering all at once and seem very useful and powerful.
