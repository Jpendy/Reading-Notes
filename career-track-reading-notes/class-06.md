- http: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
- safe methods: should only be used for information retrieval and should not change the server state.
- Idempotent methods: if two identical requests are made they should get an identical response.
- Cacheable: the client should be able to cache the response.
- REST: Representational State Transfer.
