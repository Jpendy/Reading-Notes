# Notes

- Mongoose instance methods: Instance methods are methods that perform some action on one particular instance of a model instead of on the entire model itself. 

- Static methods perform an action on the entire model

- 4 types of mongoose middleware: document middleware, model middleware, aggregate middleware, and query middleware.
