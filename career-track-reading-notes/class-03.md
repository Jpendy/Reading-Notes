1. To organize elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another

2. create, read, update and delete

3. Postgres: Object-relational database
   MongoDB: NoSQL

4. Mongoose is a Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Nose.js. It manages relationships b/w data, provides schema validation and uses it to translate b/w objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB. We need it because it acts as a liason between the node.js files we create and the database that is MongoDB.
