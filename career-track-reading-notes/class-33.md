# Notes
- Model − It simply holds the data and has nothing to do with any of the business logic.

- ViewModel − It acts as the link/connection between the Model and View and makes stuff look good.

- View − It simply holds the formatted data and essentially delegates everything to the Model

- To avoid the problems caused by putting application logic in code-behind or XAML, it's best to use a technique known as separated presentation.
