# Notes

- Only call a hook at the top level of a component, and not inside any functions or conditionals.

- Custom Hooks are JavaScript functions whose names are prefixed with the word use. A custom Hook is a normal function but we hold them to a different standard. By adding the word use to the beginning, it lets us know that this function follows the rules of Hooks.
