# Notes

- For a long time there wasn't any good ways to store data locally.

- eventually internet explorer could store 64 kb of data, then for a while flash could store 100 kb

- Then html 5 and local storage allowed us to 5 mb of strings in  key value pair properties

- local storage works across pretty much all modern browsers

- indexedDB might be the next thing that leads the way in local storage strategies
