# Notes

- In this age we now have the ability to study our work environments in more sophisticated ways than ever before.

- 5 years ago google began attempts at building the perfect team.

- Teams that perform best seem to have a culture where everyone speaks equally and everyone feels psychologically safe to say things and take risks.

- members of successful groups also tend to be sensitive to the emotions and feelings of the other group members.
 
- People need to feel free and safe to act like their true selves at work.
